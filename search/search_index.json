The process of adding specificity to something in order to not confuse it with something similar is known as disambiguation. In TagStudio we give the option to automatically disambiguate tag names based on a specially marked Parent Tag. Parent tags are explained in further detail below, but for the purposes of tag names they can lend themselves to clarifying the name of a tag without the user needing to manually change the name or add complicated aliases.</p> <p>Given a tag named \"Freddy\", we may confuse it with other \"Freddy\" tags in our library. There are lots of Freddys in the world, after all. If we're talking about Freddy from \"Five Nights at Freddy's\", then we may already (and likely should) have a separate \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" tag added as a parent tag. When the disambiguation box next to a parent tag is selected (see image below) then our tag name will automatically display its name with that parent tag's name (or shorthand if available) in parentheses.</p> <p></p> <p>So if the \"Five Night's at Fredddy's\" tag is added as a parent tag on the \"Freddy\" tag, and the disambiguation box next to it is checked, then our tag name will automatically be displayed as \"Freddy (Five Nights at Freddy's)\". Better yet, if the \"Five Night's at Fredddy's\" tag has a shorthand such as \"FNAF\", then our \"Freddy\" tag will be displayed as \"Freddy (FNAF)\". This process preserves our base tag name (\"Freddy\") and provides an option to get a clean and consistent method to display disambiguating parent categories, rather than having to type this information in manually for each applicable tag.</p>"},{"location":"library/tag/#tag-relationships","title":"Tag Relationships","text":"<p>One of the core properties of tags in TagStudio is their ability to form relationships with other tags, just as attributes have relationships with each other in real life. A rectangle is a square, but a square isn't a rectangle. A certain plumber with a red hat and blue overalls might be part of a well-known media franchise, developed by an equally well-known company. But how do representing these relationships help with tagging images and files?

By allowing tags to have inheritance relationships, we can have a single <code>Shrek</code> tag inherit from <code>Character</code> (Shrek IS a character) as well as from a separate <code>Shrek (Movie Franchise)</code> tag that itself inherits from <code>Movie Franchise</code> and <code>Dreamworks</code>. Now by simply adding the <code>Shrek</code> tag to an image, we've effectively also added the <code>Character</code>, <code>Shrek (Move Franchise)</code>, <code>Movie Franchise</code>, and <code>Dreamworks</code> attributes all in one go.

While you focus on tagging your files with seemingly surface level attributes, your TagStudio library is building rich connections between tags and files that may not be fully apparent until being discovered through various search queries.

Any tags (not currently inheriting from either the \"Favorite\" or \"Archived\" tags) will be shown under the default \"Tags\" header upon migrating to the v9.5+ library format.
